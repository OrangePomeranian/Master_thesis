# Master_thesis
My master thesis focuses on analysis of SNPs from NGS data, that have the greatest impact on appearance of tumor in mammary glands in dogs. With the use of Manhattan Plots I detected which SNP are the most significant, and later examined them with different genetic models. All analysis are conducted with tools such as Plink and SNPassoc (R library).![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67764136/236002460-167747d4-c236-472d-988b-be41682f2c84.png)
